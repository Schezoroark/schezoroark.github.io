            <p>Generally, the objective of Puyo Puyo games is to defeat all opponents in a battle by causing the third spot from the left in the top row to become occupied by something that does not immediately leave. Puyo are round, slime-like creatures
                who, in most variations of the game, fall from the top of the screen in groups of two, three, and four. The piece can be moved, dropped, and rotated using the controller or joystick. The piece falls until it reaches another Puyo or the
                bottom of the screen.[1] When four or more Puyo of the same color line up adjacent to each other, the Puyo will connect to each other, "Pop", and disappear. Puyo of the same color can connect horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.[citation
                needed]
            </p>

            <p>Puyo above those that are cleared fall onto other pieces or the bottom of the screen. Simultaneous Pops (同時消し, simultaneous erasing) are created when more than one group is formed at a time.[citation needed]
            </p>

            <p>A Chain is made when falling Puyo cause a new group of Puyo to Pop, making a chain reaction. When a Chain is achieved, Nuisance Puyo, or Ojama Puyo (お邪魔ぷよ, hindrance Puyo) are sent to either clog the opponent's screen or to cancel out (offset,
                相殺) the Nuisance Puyo sent by the opponent. Nuisance Puyo are translucent pieces that disappear when Puyo are popped next to them. If multiple groups of Puyo are cleared in succession due to a chain, the amount of Nuisance Puyo will increase
                based solely on the number of steps in the chain. Nuisance Puyo are cached above the opponent's playing field, and do not fall until the attacker's chain concludes, and then the defender puts down a piece. Nuisance Puyo block the opponents'
                playing fields, and can cause them to lose if one is placed the third spot from the left in the top row.[citation needed]

            <p>The first Puyo Puyo game was developed by Compile and released in 1991 for the MSX2 and Family Computer Disk System; the latter release was published by Tokuma Shoten as a pack-in for their Famimaga magazine. The puzzle game features characters
                from the 1990 role-playing video game Madō Monogatari 1-2-3, also developed by Compile. The game includes "Endless" mode, where the player attempts to amass a large score, "Mission" mode, where the player is given a pre-configured board
                and must attempt to satisfy conditions, and a two-player competitive mode.[citation needed]</p>

            <p>Compile and Sega collaborated to create an arcade version of Puyo Puyo. It was released in October 1992 for Sega's System C2 hardware.[2] Unlike the previous release, the game focuses on competitive play; the single-player mode consists of
                a gauntlet consisting of either 3, 10, or 13 computer opponents, while the multiplayer mode allows two human players to battle each other. The game was ported to several major platforms in Japan, with the Mega Drive becoming a bestseller.[3]</p>

            <p>The game was followed by Puyo Puyo 2 in September 1994, also released for Sega System C2.[4] Puyo Puyo 2 adds the ability to counter the opponent's chains; additionally, it changes the single-player gauntlet from a linear structure to a roulette-based
                structure that requires the player to pass certain score thresholds to advance. Like its predecessor, Puyo Puyo 2 was released on a variety of home platforms. In 2004, it was included in the Sega Ages 2500 line of PlayStation 2 games.[citation
                needed]
            </p>

            <p>Puyo Puyo Sun, released in 1996 for the Sega Titan Video arcade hardware, adds a "Sun Puyo" mechanic that allows the player to send extra Nuisance[clarification needed] to opponents. Puyo Puyo~n, released in 1999 for the Dreamcast, adds character-specific
                powers that assist the player in clearing Puyo. Compile's final Puyo Puyo game, Puyo Puyo BOX, includes ports of the first two arcade games alongside original content.[citation needed]</p>

            <p>Compile released a variety of spin-off titles on home consoles, handhelds, and through their Disc Station disk magazine. The Nazo Puyo series expands on the original Puyo Puyo's Mission mode, with the 1994 Nazo Puyo: Arle no Roux for Game
                Gear, 1995 Super Nazo Puyo: Rulue no Roux for Super Famicom and 1996 Super Nazo Puyo 2: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjouki for Super Famicom introducing role-playing elements. Other notable spin-offs include the roguelike Waku Waku Puyo Puyo Dungeon
                (1998, Sega Saturn and PlayStation), Puyo Puyo DA! dancing game (1998, arcade and Dreamcast), and Arle no Bouken: Mahou no Jewel monster-collecting role-playing game (2000, Game Boy Color).[citation needed]

            </div>
            <p>Sonic Team's first Puyo Puyo games were Minna de Puyo Puyo for the Game Boy Advance, released in Japan in 2001 and elsewhere in 2002 as Puyo Pop. It is one of three games named Puyo Pop, the others being the Neo Geo Pocket Color port of Puyo
                Puyo 2 and an N-Gage game.[citation needed]</p>

            <p>Sega released Puyo Pop Fever on November 26, 2003 for their NAOMI arcade hardware. The game features a mostly new set of characters, alongside new gameplay mechanics such as Fever Mode. Like its arcade predecessors, Fever was ported to many
                platforms; the Dreamcast version notably serves as Sega's final first party video game. A direct sequel, Puyo Puyo Fever 2 was released in 2005. Fever 2 added more characters and an expanded single-player mode. Puyo Puyo 7, released in
                2009, adds a third protagonist and includes a new "Transformation" gameplay system.[citation needed]</p>

            <p>In addition, games celebrating Puyo Puyo's 15th and 20th Anniversary were released. Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary (2006) includes more than ten gameplay rulesets, including the rules of the first Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo 2, and Puyo Puyo Fever,
                reintroduces characters that were absent from the series since Minna de Puyo Puyo, and gives every character in the game a single-player story. Puyo Puyo!! 20th Anniversary (2011) adds even more rulesets, such as Sun rules.[citation needed]</p>

            <p>Puyo Puyo Tetris, released in 2014, includes both Puyo Puyo and Tetris gameplay.[5]</p>

            <p>Puyo Puyo!! Quest is a free-to-play role-playing game released for iOS and Android in 2013. Sega has claimed that the game is a major success, and stated that the game has reached 11 million downloads and a monthly income of over 500 million
                yen (approx. US$4 million, using February 20, 2015 exchange rates) as of February 2015.[6]
            </p>

            <p>Puyo Puyo was a mini-game in Hatsune Miku: Project Mirai Deluxe/DX in 2015.[citation needed]</p>

            <p>Puyo Puyo Chronicle was released on December 8, 2016, in Japan for Nintendo 3DS, as part of the original Puyo Puyo game's 25th anniversary with no plans for localization, despite the demand for it. Unlike the other anniversary games, it features
                an role-playing game mode, although the classic rules are also included, and features a new character named Ally.[7]</p>

            <p>Puyo Puyo Champions (named Puyo Puyo eSports in Japan), a digital title with an emphasis on eSports tournament play, was released for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch on October 25, 2018 in Japan. It was released in North America and Europe
                on May 7, 2019.[8]</p>

            <h3>International releases</h3>

            </div>
            <p>The 1992 arcade Puyo Puyo was translated to English with character name changes and minor visual changes to Harpy, renamed Dark Elf, character's skit. Sega added this version into their Sega Ages port on Nintendo Switch.[9]
            </p>

            <p>Instead of directly translating the Mega Drive version of the 1992 arcade game, Sega decided to replace the Madou Monogatari cast with villains from the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog animated television series. The resulting game, Dr. Robotnik's
                Mean Bean Machine, was released in 1993, along with a Game Gear version adapted from Nazo Puyo. Nintendo followed suit in 1995, modifying Super Puyo Puyo into Kirby's Avalanche (Kirby's Ghost Trap in Europe). Spectrum HoloByte also released
                a Puyo Puyo title for Microsoft Windows 3.1 and the Macintosh in August 1995, under the name Qwirks.[10]
            </p>

            <p>The next localized release was in 1999, when SNK published the Neo Geo Pocket Color port of Puyo Puyo 2 in English as Puyo Pop. Unlike the arcade translation, most characters kept their original names; only the character Satan retained his
                English arcade title of the Dark Prince.[citation needed] After the Game Boy Advance Puyo Pop, Puyo Pop Fever saw a worldwide release, with North America receiving the GameCube and Nintendo DS versions and Europe receiving it on the majority
                of platforms it came out on.[citation needed] Finally, the Mega Drive version of Puyo Puyo 2 was released, untranslated, on the Wii's Virtual Console as an import title and the arcade version of Puyo Puyo 2 is included in Sega 3D Classics
                Collection.[citation needed] Also the N-Gage Puyo Pop was released worldwide in 2003.[citation needed] As the game Hatsune Miku: Project Mirai Deluxe/DX was released worldwide, consequently also its Puyo Puyo mini-game saw release outside
                Japan. Sonic Runners ran a collaboration event with Puyo Puyo!! Quest in July 2015.[citation needed]
            </p>

            <p>On January 12, 2017, it was announced that Puyo Puyo Tetris would come overseas on the Nintendo Switch and the PlayStation 4 in Q2 2017.[11] This marks the first time a localized Puyo Puyo game was marketed overseas under its original name.</p>

            <h3>Other releases</h3>

            <p>Disney Interactive Studios released its own version of Puyo Puyo for Windows 95 and Macintosh named Timon & Pumbaa's Bug Drop in 1995 as part of the Disney's Hot Shots series of PC games. This version features Disney characters Timon & Pumbaa
                from The Lion King, and Puyo are replaced by bugs.[12] This version was also included in the PC compilation game Timon & Pumbaa's Jungle Games, simply titled Bug Drop.[citation needed]
            </p>

            <p>2003's Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg features an unlockable Puyo Pop minigame, which requires the use of the GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable to download the minigame to a Game Boy Advance.[13]</p>

            <p>In July 2005, Bandai released Kidou Gekidan Haro Ichiza: Haro no Puyo Puyo (機動劇団はろ一座 ハロのぷよぷよ) (lit. "Mobile Theatrical Company Haro: Haro's Puyo Puyo") in Japan for the GBA.[14] It is based on the Mobile Suit Gundam anime series and presented
                in the style of the SD Gundam series. In this game, Puyo are replaced by Gundam's mascot, Haro.</p>

            <p>On September 10, 2015, it was announced that Rin Hoshizora of the anime Love Live! will serve as the new star of the Puyo Puyo games, though it is unknown if this is to be a one-time spin-off (similar to Haro no Puyo Puyo) or a part of the
                main series.[15]</p>

            <p>A new mobile game, Puyo!! Touch, was released for iOS and Android devices in November 26, 2015.[16]</p>

            <p>A free-to-play version, Puyo Puyo Vs., was released for Microsoft Windows and focuses on multiplayer battles, but the service shutdown in 2016 due to the low market-share of people playing.[17]</p>

            <p>Sonic Mania (2017) contains a Puyo Puyo minigame as a boss battle in the Chemical Plant Zone and as an unlockable mode, directly referencing Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine. Director Christian Whitehead considered it the most "complex" boss
                fight for them to develop.[18][19]</p>

            <p>Puyo Puyo is playable via in-game arcade machines in Yakuza 6 and Judgment.[20]</p>

            <p>Puyo Puyo was originally conceived by Compile employee and Sting Entertainment founder Kazunari Yonemitsu. Yonemitsu felt that the puzzle games at the time had "weak" characters and thus decided to create a puzzle game using characters from
                Compile's Madou Monogatari RPG series. The success of Street Fighter II influenced Puyo Puyo's focus on competitive gameplay, with Yonemitsu trying out many mechanics in an attempt to recapture the fighting game's competitive nature.[21]</p>

            <p>In March 1998, Sega obtained the rights to the Puyo Puyo series and its characters from Compile, while Compile continued to develop and publish Puyo Puyo games, even on platforms that Sega was competing against. These games include Sega in
                their copyright information.[22][23][24] Prior to assuming full development duties for the franchise, Sega ported Puyo Puyo 2 to the WonderSwan and Neo Geo Pocket Color.</p>

            <h2>Sales</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Sega Sammy reported in 2018 that the sum of physical copies sold, digital copies sold, unique registrations to Puyo Puyo!! Quest, and DL of free-to-play titles totals 27 million.[25] This figure does not account for units sold prior to Sega's
                acquisition of the series.</p>
